%% Notes: 
%%    1. Write your answers inside a \begin{solution}...\end{solution} environment.
%%
%%    2. If you will use references, insert bibtex reference entries in the file
%%       Math700.bib.  (Create that file if it doesn't yet exist.)
%%
%%    3. If you will use acronyms, please define them in the macros.tex file.

%%    4. Please try to check that your file compiles:
%%
%%       Mac OS X users: you might try MacTeX. 
%%       Windows users: you might try proTeXt. 
%%       Linux users: most come with TeX; otherwise do a full install of TeXLive.
%%
%%       There is a Makefile in this directory, so on Linux you could just 
%%       enter `make` to compile all the Homework*.tex files at once.
%%
%%    5. Please don't hesitate to inform the prof if you have trouble, or open
%%       a ``New issue'' or create a new ``Wiki page'' on GitHub.  Otherwise,
%%       send an email to williamdemeo@gmail.com.
%%
%%    6. It will probably be hard to keep everyone's notation consistent.
%%       For the most basic symbols, we should have some conventions and use
%%       LaTeX macros to keep the conventions consistent and easy to remember.
%%       For example, to denote an algebra,
         \newcommand\alg[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbf{#1}}}
         \newcommand{\<}{\ensuremath{\langle}}
         \renewcommand{\>}{\ensuremath{\rangle}}
%%       So, an algebra in LaTeX is typed as $\alg{A} = \<A, F\>$.
%%       Similarly, for a field, let's use:
         \newcommand\fld[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbb{#1}}}
%%       So, a field in LaTeX is typed as $\fld{F}$.
%%       Example: We denote the integers by \fld{Z}. 
%%                This comes up often enough that it's useful to define
         \newcommand\Z{\fld{Z}}
%%
%%       For the Galois field, we use:
         \newcommand\GF{\ensuremath{\operatorname{GF}}}
%%
%%    7. Replace these names with yours!!!

\begin{problem}[Golan 56]

Is it possible to define on $\Z/(4)$ the structure of a vector space over
$\GF(2)$ in such a way that the vector addition is the usual addition in
$\Z/(4)$?\\
\\
~[{\it Hints}: Recall that $(n)$ denotes the set $\{\dots, -2n, -n, 0, n, 2n,
  3n, \dots\}$, which we denoted in lecture by $n\Z$.  This is the ideal
  generated by $n$ in the ring $\Z$, but don't worry about that for now. Just
  take $\Z/(n)$ to be the abelian group of integers $\{0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1\}$
  with addition modulo $n$.  In lecture, we used $\Z/n\Z$ to denote
  $\Z/(n)$. Use whichever notation you prefer.]

\begin{problem}[Golan 60]

Let $V = C(0,1)$. Define an operation $\boxplus$ on $V$ by setting 
$f \boxplus g : x \mapsto \max \{f(x), g(x)\}$.  
Does this operation of vector addition, together with the usual scalar
multiplication make $V$ into a vector space over $\R$?

\begin{problem}[Golan 63]

Let $V = \{ i \in \Z \mid 0 \leq i < 2^n \}$ for some fixed positive integer
$n$.  Define operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication on $V$ in
such a way as to turn it into a vector space over $\GF(2)$.\\
\\
~[{\it Hints}: Recall that $\GF(2)$ denotes the Galois field with two elements,
  $\{0, 1\}$, with addition mod 2 and the usual multiplication.
  Other than this field, the only restriction given in the
  problem is that $V$ must have $2^n$ elements. Do you know of any sets of this size?]

Let $V = \R^\R$ and let $W$ be the subset of $V$ containing the constant
function $x\mapsto 0$ and all of those functions $f \in V$ satisfying the
following condition: $f(a) = 0$ for at most finitely many real numbers $a$.  Is
$W$ a subspace of $V$.\\

\begin{problem}[Golan 79]

A function $f \in \R^\R$ is \emph{piecewise constant} if and only if it is a
constant function $x \mapsto c$ or there exist 
$a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n$ and 
$c_0 < c_1 < \cdots < c_n$ in $\R$ such that 
\[
f : x \mapsto 
\begin{cases}
  c_0 & \text{ if $x < a_1$,}\\
  c_i & \text{ if $a_i\leq x < a_i$ for $1\leq i < n$,}\\
  c_n & \text{ if $a_n\leq x$.}
\end{cases}
\]
Does the set of all piecewise constant functions form a subspace of the vector
space $\R^\R$ over $\R$?
