%%test This is the Homework LaTeX template.  Use this file to fill in your solutions. 
%%
%% Notes: 
%%    1. Write your answers inside a \begin{solution}...\end{solution} environment.
%%
%%    2. If you will use references, insert bibtex reference entries in the file
%%       Math700.bib.  (Create that file if it doesn't yet exist.)
%%
%%    3. If you will use acronyms, please define them in the macros.tex file.
%%
%%    4. Please try to check that your file compiles:
%%
%%       Mac OS X users: you might try MacTeX. 
%%       Windows users: you might try proTeXt. 
%%       Linux users: most come with TeX; otherwise do a full install of TeXLive.
%%
%%       There is a Makefile in this directory, so on Linux you could just 
%%       enter `make` to compile all the Homework*.tex files at once.
%%
%%    5. Please don't hesitate to inform the prof if you have trouble, or open
%%       a ``New issue'' or create a new ``Wiki page'' on GitHub.  Otherwise,
%%       send an email to williamdemeo@gmail.com.
%%
%%    6. It will probably be hard to keep everyone's notation consistent.
%%       For the most basic symbols, we should have some conventions and use
%%       LaTeX macros to keep the conventions consistent and easy to remember.
%%       For example, to denote an algebra,
         \newcommand\alg[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbf{#1}}}
         \newcommand{\<}{\ensuremath{\langle}}
         \renewcommand{\>}{\ensuremath{\rangle}}
%%       So, an algebra in LaTeX is typed as $\alg{A} = \<A, F\>$.
%%       Similarly, for a field, let's use:
         \newcommand\fld[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbb{#1}}}
%%       So, a field in LaTeX is typed as $\fld{F}$.

%%
%%    7. Replace these names with yours!!!

\begin{prob}[Golan 16]
Let $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$ be complex numbers satisfying 
$|z_i| = 1$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$. Show that 
$|z_1 z_2 + z_1 z_3 + z_2 z_3 | = |z_1 + z_2 + z_3|$.
\end{prob}

\smallskip
\begin{hint}
Let $w =  z_1 z_2 z_3$. Note that the modulus of $w$ is $|w| = 1$, since each $z_i$ has modulus 1.
The left hand side of the equality we want to establish is
$| w/z_3 + w/z_2 + w/z_1 |$.
Factoring out $|w|$, we have $|w| |1/z_3 + 1/z_2 + 1/z_1|$.
Note that since $|z_i|=1$, the conjugate of $z_i$ is $1/z_i$.
\end{hint}

\begin{prob}[Golan 22 {\it Abel's inequality}] 
Let $z_1, \dots, z_n$ be a list of complex
numbers and, for each $1 \leq k \leq n$, 
let $s_k = \sum_{i=1}^k z_i$. For real numbers
$a_1, \dots, a_n$ satisfying 
$a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \cdots \geq a_n \geq 0$, 
show that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Abels}  
\left| \sum_{i=1}^n a_i z_i \right| 
\leq a_1 \left( \max_{1 \leq k \leq n} |s_k|\right).
\end{equation}
\end{prob}
\smallskip
\begin{hint}
The $k$th term of $\sum a_i z_i$ is 
\[
a_k z_k = a_k (z_1+\cdots + z_k) - a_k (z_1+\cdots + z_{k-1})
= a_k s_k - a_k s_{k-1},
\]
so
% \begin{align*}
% \left| \sum_{i=1}^n a_i z_i \right|  
% &= \left|a_n s_n - a_n s_{n-1}\right.\\
% & + a_{n-1} s_{n-1} - a_{n-1} s_{n-2} \\
% & \vdots\\
% &\left.+ a_2 s_2 - a_2 s_1 + a_1 s_1\right|.
% \end{align*}
\begin{align*}
\left| \sum_{i=1}^n a_i z_i \right|  
&= \left|a_n s_n - a_n s_{n-1}
+ a_{n-1} s_{n-1} - a_{n-1} s_{n-2} + \cdots +a_2 s_2 - a_2 s_1 + a_1
s_1\right|\\
&=\left| s_1(a_1-a_2)+ s_2(a_2-a_3) + \cdots + s_{n-1}(a_{n-1}-a_n) + s_{n}a_n
\right|.
\end{align*}
Now use the triangle inequality to bound this expression, and then factor
a certain maximum out of the sum. If you recognize what remains of the sum as a
telescoping series, the desired inequality will reveal itself. 
(You should try to write down the proof, either following the
suggestions outlined above and filling in the missing details, or by finding an
alternative solution of your own.)
